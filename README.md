# css-zines

Making a zine using HTML and CSS.

Requirements (~ are nice-haves):
- output: single HTML file, ready for printing
- layout using CSS
    - ~CSS grid?
    - add CSS styles for printing
- text marked for translation
- including images
- adding accessibility support:
    - changing fonts (from cute handwritten one to a readable one)
    - ~increasing text easily
    - ~dark mode
- use handwritten font
    - ~create a monospace version of the font

# plan

1. Use existing Haskell notes to write a zine in HTML + CSS
2. Repeat the process for another two notes, to get the commonalities
3. Create partials for common elements
4. Create a setup for generating common elements
5. Publish a few pages for review
